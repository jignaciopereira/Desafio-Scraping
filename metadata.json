Morton, the Benefactor of Mankind, with the Gratitude of Humanity.' Frost drives to a country farmhouse and gives the medal to Morton's widow, Elizabeth Morton who explains to her daughter, Betty, that Frost was the first person given anesthesia by her father, Boston dentist Dr. W.T.G. Morton. The story flashes back 20 years to find Morton being wildly acclaimed by medical students as the man whose discovery of 'letheon' had forever ended pain as, before that day, even amputations were performed with the patient fully conscious. 'Letheron', unknown to everybody but Morton and Elizabeth, is simply highly rectified sulfuric ether - cleaning fluid - easily obtainable at a pharmacy. By keeping the secret, Dr. Morton could be rich, but he had rather be poor than see a girl strapped to an operating table under the knife of Dr. Warren, and he reveals his secret to a group of surgeons in the hospital operating theatre. With his secret out, and all hope of personal reward gone, with the possible exception of proceeds from his glass inhaler, he gets the news that Congress has voted him a reward of $100,000, and also learns that the patent on his inhaler has been infringed. President Pierce, under pressure from newspapers inflamed by jealous medical rivals of Morton, refuses to sign the bill until Morton has proven patient infringement. —Les Adams ", "likes": 1, "rating": 6.3, "comentarios": []}, "1": {"titulo": "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End", "anio": "2007", "generos": ["Action", "Adventure", "Family", "Fantasy"], "director": "Gore Verbinski", "elenco": ["Johnny Depp", "Valiant Michael", "Peter Donald Badalamenti II", "Arnold Chon"], "sinopsis": " After Elizabeth, Will, and Captain Barbossa rescue Captain Jack Sparrow from the land of the dead, they must face their foes, Davy Jones and Lord Cutler Beckett.

Much to their regret, they have not been able to have children. One day, a mysterious stranger appears to Mara and promises her that she will bear a son whom she is to call Samson. The stranger tells her that as one chosen by God Samson will fight the Philistines, will have immense strength at his disposal, but that he may never cut his hair (or drink alcohol); otherwise this gift will be lost. Samson is born and as foretold he grows into a boy with amazing strength. As time passes, Samson becomes an attractive young man and young women begin to interest him more and more. Naomi, a pretty but rather melancholic girl, falls deeply in love with him. During a walk Samson learns the young woman's story. When she was a small child, her village was exterminated by the Philistines and her whole family butchered. Since then Naomi has not only been in mourning, but she harbors an unbridled desire for retaliation. She tries to convince Samson to join a group of young people planning an insurrection. Samson with his incredible strength could be a symbol, a hero, of this uprising! Initially Samson rejects the idea, but when Naomi provokes a confrontation with the Philistines he naturally hurries to her rescue. Soon the news spreads, not only to the Israelite villages but also to the Philistine royal palace in Gaza, that an Israelite by the name of Samson has killed several Philistines with his bare hands. When King Hanun, his hot-tempered son Sidqa and General Tariq hear this, they are anything but enthusiastic. They deliberate about what can be done to restrain this Samson before a revolt breaks out. Delilah, the king's beautiful, seductive and scheming niece insists on being present during these conversations. Samson is still not fully aware of the role he is supposed to play for his people. God has not yet given him a sign. One day he sneaks into a Philistine camp without having an exact plan on how he is going to proceed against them. Here he sees Delilah for the first time and is immediately fascinated by her. Just at this moment, a wounded desert lion bounds enters the camp and attacks Delilah. Without hesitating, Samson confronts the lion unarmed and after a terrible struggle, overpowers it with his bare hands. For reasons unfathomable to the Philistines who witness this, General Tariq lets the Israelite Samson go free. Like Delilah, the experienced general has been impressed by the scene and is curious to find out what sort of person Samson is. Back in the royal palace Tariq, who has grown wise with age, suggests concluding peace with the Israelites to King Hanun. The General, however, cannot put this idea across against the fierce resistance of Prince Sidqa, who is planning to take Samson prisoner. To accomplish this he bribes two Israelites, Jehiel and Amram childhood companions of Samson's. The pair, sons of Samson's friend and mentor Ira, are jealous of Samson because they would like to assume the leadership of the Israelites themselves. They see their position endangered by Samson and are only too happy to get rid of him. Initially, the plan seems to work and Samson is caught in a trap. Thanks to his strength, he succeeds in breaking free and fleeing from his captors. With Yoram's help Samson manages to hide in Ira's home. When Samson and Ira learn that Jehiel and Amram, of all people are behind the attempt on Samson's life, Ira disowns his sons. Angered and dissapointed by the betrayal of his own people Samson flees into the desert. There, he comes upon the corpse of the lion he killed and sees that bees have nested in it. Samson is so hungry that he contravenes God's command and eats the impure honey. From now on Samson will stray from the path of righteousness and will only find his way back after taking many risks and suffering much pain. In the desert, Samson encounters Amrok, an Israelite, who has been raised by the Philistines like one of their own. Amrok invites Samson to the village of his foster-father Harach, where Samson, much to his amazement, is very warmly received. Samson is surprised to be received in such a friendly manner by Harach and his family. His concept of the Philistines as enemies threatens to collapse, especially after he sets eyes on Rani, Harach's pretty and delightful daughter. Samson and Rani are immediately strongly attracted to each other and after Harach and even King Hanun have declared their consent, Samson and Rani decide to marry. A solemn wedding banquet is to crown the ceremony. The King even sends thirty Philistines to preside at the function. During the course of the festivities, the atmosphere becomes very lively and Samson poses a riddle promising the one who guesses the answer thirty sheep and festive attire. After being put under pressure by Mahal, the leader of the Philistine wedding group, Rani discloses the answer to the riddle. Angered and disappointed by this betrayal, Samson slays the thirty Philistines so that Mahal can have their clothes as a reward. Samson's vengeance is not yet over: in his anger he sets the fields of the Philistines on fire, conjuring up an even greater disaster. Following orders from Prince Sidqa, Mahal kills Rani and Harach for having betrayed their people As Samson visits the town Rani came from, Amrok tells him about the atrocities committed by Mahal. Samson, deeply moved by all this suffering, suddenly has a vague premonition that all is not well at home and decides to return to his parents. He arrives home to find his father Manoa on his deathbed. Shortly before Manoa passes away, father and son who have been estranged ever since Samson's marriage to Rani, reconcile. After Manoa's death, Samson hastily sets off again. He knows the Philistine henchmen cannot be far off and his does not want to endanger his mother. When Samson finally arrives in Gaza he sets about searching for the traitor Mahal, and once he has found him, kills him. The Philistines are alarmed when they hear that Samson is supposedly in the city. To cut off all routes of escape, they close the city gates. They are dismayed when they discover that the gates, weighing tons, have been lifted off their hinges and that Samson has disappeared. Since Samson apparently cannot be captured by conventional means, the royal court decides to use a woman's charms instead. Delilah is promised jewels and wealth to seduce Samson and worm out of him the secret of his supernatural strength. The inevitable comes to pass: Samson falls in love with the bewitching Delilah. The enchantress plays her part well and after much cajoling and teasing, she gets Samson to disclose his big secret: If his long hair were to be shorn he would lose all his strength. Although Delilah has to struggle with her feelings she finally cuts off his hair, thus enabling the Philistines to take Samson prisoner. Once they have him captured, they blind him for good measure. While languishing in prison, a blind and helpless Samson finally becomes conscious of his numerous mistakes and presumptuousness and recognizes God's greatness. Through his sufferings, the once proud and reckless youth matures into a humble and truly religious man. While performing forced labor every day, he prays that his hair will soon grow back so that he can fulfil his calling. In the meantime the Israelites under the leadership of Jehiel and Amram, instigate a revolt against the Philistines. This uprising is mercilessly crushed by General Tariq. Naomi is among the few survivors. She desperately wants to see Samson one more time. Overcoming all feelings of bitterness Naomi goes to Delilah to ask for her help. Delilah, whose conscience gives her no peace, is prepared to help Naomi, if Naomi can convince Samson to forgive her. A sumptuous feast is held in the temple of the Philistine god, Dagon. The highlight of the festivities is to be the presentation of the tamed and helpless Samson. During the course of the festivities, Delilah manages to speak to Samson. Blind and unsuspecting, and assuming she is Naomi, Samson gives Delilah a kiss of forgiveness on the forehead. The time has now come for him to complete his task. Samson, who has regained his strength, braces himself against the pillars of the temple and brings the walls of the whole temple tumbling down. While young Yoram, Naomi and Delilah are able to flee at the very last moment, the massive walls forever bury Samson, King Hanun and his son Prince Sidqa, General Tariq and countless Philistines beneath them. —Anonymous ", "likes": 12, "rating": 5.9, "comentarios": [" Glenck hubop druklo dembork.

Joseph, the favored son of the patriarch Jacob, was given into captivity by his own envious brothers. A tireless and highly productive worker, Joseph wins his master's trust and is named steward of Potiphar's household. However, Joseph also unwittingly arouses the lust of Potiphar's wife. Luring him into her room one day, she orders Joseph to give her pleasure. But Joseph prefers punishment, even death, to betraying his master. As he flees from the room, the desperate woman tears off Joseph's garment and brandishes it as proof of her violation. As Potiphar questions him, Joseph begins to narrate the story of his past, a tale of suffering and hardship. We flash back to the time when Jacob and his family settled near the town of Schechem. It is a brief and unhappy stay, for when Jacob's daughter Dinah is ravished by the young prince of Schechem, Jacob's sons decide to exact revenge with a bloodbath - despite an agreement reached between Jacob and the Schechemites. As Jacob and his family flee, Rachel, Jacob's beloved wife, dies while giving birth to Benjamin. A few years elapse, and Jacob's older sons become increasingly resentful of their father's preference for Joseph. When Joseph turns seventeen, his father has a wonderful colored coat made for him, which further excites the jealousy of the brothers. When Joseph is sent to a distant pasture one day to look after his brothers, they seize him, tear off his coat, throw him into a dry well and, the following day, sell him as a slave to traders on their way to Egypt. This is how he enters the service of Potiphar. Despite his doubts about his wife's version of the 'rape', Potiphar has Joseph jailed to vindicate his wife publicly. In prison, Joseph is assigned to attend two high court officials who are suspected of having stolen a bracelet from the Pharaoh. Tormented by dreams, the men ask Joseph for help. Joseph tells the cup-bearer that he will be reinstated, and the chief-baker that he will hang. Two years later, the cup-bearer remembers Joseph when the Pharaoh is unable to obtain from his priests a rational interpretation of two anguishing dreams. Joseph is summoned and predicts that after seven years of plentiful harvest, Egypt will suffer seven years of famine. Convinced, the Pharaoh appoints Joseph as his chancellor and gives him a beautiful Egyptian woman as his wife. Joseph immediately begins to put aside a fifth of the country's harvest. After seven years a murderous famine strikes, driving people from nations near and far to come to Egypt to buy grain. Among the famished, Joseph recognizes his brothers. Testing them to see if they have changed, Joseph is satisfied and reveals his identity. Finally reunited with his beloved brother Benjamin and his father Jacob, Joseph reconciles with his family, and the Pharaoh invites them to settle in Egypt as overseers of his livestock. —Anonymous ", "likes": 1, "rating": 7.7, "comentarios": [" fiction rules !

The Wonder Circus is a traveling circus owned and operated by Anthony Wonder - who performs as a clown - and his daughter Kitty Wonder - who performs as an aerialist and trick rider. Although Kitty loves her Pop as she and all the other circus performers call her father, she hates his gambling addiction which is placing the circus deep in debt. They and their employees treat the circus like one big family, especially Lulu the fortune teller who wants to be Mrs. Wonder, but the employees may only be so loyal if they aren't getting paid. As such, many of the performers leave or threaten to leave to join the Wonder Circus' main competitor, the Noble Circus owned by the power and money hungry John Noble. Although Pop and Kitty don't want anyone to leave their employ, the only act that they will never let go is Jumbo, their trained elephant, who Noble had tried to buy in the past. As many performers leave, into their midst comes circus Jack-of-all-trades Sam Rawlins. Kitty is reluctant to hire Sam because she wants loyal people working for them instead of someone like Sam who she sees as a 'sunshiner', a career circus employee who moves from gig to gig. Pop has no such reservation and hires him. Despite still being somewhat suspicious of Sam's motivations since she figures he could get more money working for Noble with his vast array of circus skills, Kitty starts to fall in love with Sam, and he with her, despite his attempts to feign disinterest. Indeed, Sam is hiding a secret about himself and his reason for being with the show. That secret may jeopardize his standing with the Wonders if they ever found out - even if Sam begins to have second thoughts about his reasons for joining them - and jeopardize the entire Wonder Circus itself which includes Jumbo's life. —Huggo ", "likes": 0, "rating": 6.2, "comentarios": [" no hay ningun enlace "]}, "17": {"titulo": "Full Clip", "anio": "2004", "generos": ["Action", "Thriller"], "director": "mink", "elenco": ["Ellen Cleghorne", "Busta Rhymes", "Xzibit", "DeRay Davis"], "sinopsis": " Joshua Pope (Busta Rhymes) returns to his childhood home to claim the inheritance his late father has left him only to find that the local police have turned the town upside down and are ruling with an iron fist.

The first-born, Esau, is a strong and fearless hunter with a voracious appetite for sensual pleasures. Jacob is a shepherd, more tender and compassionate han Esau. Just as Esau is the pride of his father, so is Jacob the apple of his mother's eye. Rebekah is convinced that Jacob, though the second born son, is the chosen one and the rightful heir of Isaac and Abraham. And she tells him that when she was with child, God announced to her: 'Two nations are within thy womb. Two manner of men shall be delivered to you. The one shall be stronger than the other and the elder shall serve the younger'. One day Esau returns from a hunt to find Jacob preparing a lentil porridge. Famished, he asks Jacob for some food. Jacob agrees, but on one condition: that Esau sell him his birthright. Since Esau ascribes little value to its meaning, he readily agrees and they conclude the pact. Time has passed. Isaac has grown old and nearly blind. It is time to pass on his paternal blessing to the firstborn. He asks Esau to hunt and prepare some game for him, after which he will give him his blessing. Rebekah knows she must act now. Cornering Jacob, she pressures him into deceiving Isaac so that he obtains the blessing instead of Esau. Jacob resists, but when Rebekah vows to take the blame for this ploy, he finally consents. And thus does Jacob trick his father. When Esau returns from the hunt and appears before his father, he explodes in anger when he learns of the scheme. Having obtained only a lesser blessing from Isaac, he vows to kill Jacob as soon as his father passes away. Isaac, following Rebekah's suggestion, advises Jacob to flee to Harran, to the home of Laban - Rebekah's brother, and to ask him to marry one of his daughters. Laden with gold, silver, skins, spices and oils, Jacob sadly leaves his home and his loved ones. Soon, however, he realizes that he is being followed: a Canaanite, one of Esau's brothers-in-law, robs him of the treasure that was to be his dowry. One night, as he is asleep, Jacob has a vision of a stairway with angel-like figures on it. During this vision God promises him protection and prosperity. The next morning, Jacob swears to remain faithful and devoted to God. After an arduous journey, Jacob arrives in Harran. Haggard and drained of his strength, he immediately forgets his fatigue when he sees a pretty young girl at the fountain. The girl is Rachel, the youngest daughter of his uncle Laban. And Jacob falls head over heels in love with her. Though Laban greets his nephew heartily, he cannot conceal his disappointment that Jacob has arrived without any gifts. Laban's two sons, Morash and Be'or, are less delighted by Jacob's arrival. Jacob soon asks Laban to let him marry Rachel, and he even accepts Laban's rigorous conditions: that Jacob become his indentured servant for a full seven years. Jacob proves to be a singularly successful herdsman and contributes mightily to the welfare of Laban's people. Thus after seven years, Laban is unwilling to let him leave and devises a cunning scheme... When Jacob awakens on the morning following the consummation of his marriage with Rachel, he is horrified to discover that he has slept with Rachel's older sister Leah instead. Laban forced Leah to take her sister's place in the dark tent. As Jacob rages, Laban claims that according to the law of the land, a father must marry off his older daughter first. He is willing, however, to make Jacob another offer: for another seven years in his service, he can take Rachel as his wife in one week's time. And again, Laban and his people enjoy seven more years of rich harvests and expanding flocks, all thanks to Jacob's superior abilities. But while the unloved Leah bears Jacob many children, Rachel, his one and only love, remains barren for many years, until Joseph finally sees the light of day. After his second period of indenture is over, Jacob strikes another deal with Laban, whereby he is allowed to assemble his own herd. His prosperity soon sparks the envy of Laban's sons Morash and Be'or, who accuse Jacob of deceiving them and of stealing their property. Jacob decides it is time to move back to Canaan, and flees with his wives, children and servants. As soon as Laban hears about their escape, he rounds up his sons and his men and gives chase. He finally meets up with Jacob on Mount Gilead. But before he can reach Jacob, God appears to Laban and warns him not to harm Jacob or his people. Jacob's most grueling ordeal, however, still awaits him: his meeting with his brother Esau. Fearing that Esau still intends to kill him, Jacob sends messengers with gifts to his brother to announce his coming. The messengers return sooner than expected, reporting that Esau is already on his way to meet him - with 400 armed men. Jacob sets up camp on the banks of the river Jabbok. That night, while his people await Esau with fear and trembling, Jacob withdraws to collect himself on the other side of the river. There Jacob is attacked by a mysterious being whom he cannot identify. It is an angel. As the struggle intensifies and the angel realizes that he cannot subdue Jacob, he strikes him fiercely on the hip. But Jacob, who gradually realizes who his adversary is, continues to grapple with him and refuses to relinquish his hold until the angel has blessed him. Ultimately the angel yields and gives Jacob the blessing together with the new name of 'Israel'. He thus confirms Jacob's right to the blessing which he originally obtained by deceit. The following morning, as Esau's army approaches, Jacob gathers his people behind him and awaits his brother. As Esau arrives at the head of his troops, Jacob humbly throws himself at his brother's feet. Esau breaks the tension by coming towards Jacob with open arms and welcoming him home. Reconciling their past differences, Jacob and Esau embrace. ", "likes": 16, "rating": 6.7, "comentarios": [" more drivel for the fantasy section... thx Freeman!

Not handsome or dashing like the other singers of his generation, Lucio Dalla embodied a different role model that was closer to ordinary people. For here was an artist capable of transposing the poetry of Roversi, who provided the lyrics for some of Dalla's most beautiful songs, into a musical arrangement that spoke to everyone.

In comparison, Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy (from the same director Hamaguchi) is a much superior film in that the flow is more natural, characters that resonate with me more, and seemingly smaller scope but still with in-depth exploration on human relationship. Though I would not disagree with what @Yuyoyi has said that it was slightly overrated, I would still recommend people to watch it and of course watch Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy as well.

Rose's mother abandoned them when Rose was five. Jack has passed to Rose a sense of ecological preservation, placing them at odds with Marty Rance, who is building a housing complex on the island on a wetlands. They are able to live this life on the commune property in their ecological bliss due to a sizable inheritance, Jack who will occasionally take out his checkbook in order to solve whatever problem he may be facing. Jack also took Rose out of school when she was eleven as he didn't believe in what the traditional school system was teaching. Their quiet life together is threatened by the fact that Jack has a heart condition which will probably kill him sooner than later. Wanting to ensure that Rose is taken care of after his passing, Jack makes the unilateral decision to ask Kathleen, a woman who he has been dating for four months, to move in, along with her two mismatched sons, half-brothers Rodney and Thaddius who don't much like each other. Jack tries to pass Kathleen and her sons to Rose as 'an experiment' and the three of them solely as 'guests', rather than the reality of them truly moving in. Kathleen, who had never met Rose before, agreed in her savior complex and in truly loving Jack, knowing fully the reasons for he asking her. These changes deeply affect Rose, who has had Jack all to herself for the better part of her life - she who threatens to commit suicide after Jack dies - and comes at a key point in her own life as she is just starting to explore her sexuality. —Huggo ", "likes": 2, "rating": 6.6, "comentarios": [" What happened to Diane?

Still today, the young Makbul grows up in daily contact with the wild and domesticated elephants that live in the forest around his native village in southern India. Over the objections of his mother, Makbul follows in the footsteps of his father and grandfather, going deep into the forest to learn the age-old profession of the mahout, or elephant handler in the government's employ. When an elephant calf named Vikrama is born, the animal is placed under Makbul's care. The boy raises and trains the elephant, but when his father dies, Makbul now head of the family but too young to be hired by the forest department, must seek work in the neighboring villages, away from the elephants. The bond between Makbul and the life of his forebears is too strong, and as he passes into adulthood, his destiny of becoming a mahout is fulfilled. But times have changed, the forest operations have come to an end and no longer require the elephants and their handlers. Vikrama is sold and Makbul is charged with delivering the elephant to its buyer. They head off across India, further and further away from the world of the forests, up to an animal fair in the north. There, Makbul understands that the buyer is a corrupt dealer who has obtained the elephant at Government rate only to sell it at a higher price to someone else. Vikrama is placed in the care of a rougher mahout and kills him. Calamity ensues, and only Makbul can save Vikrama from further misfortune. And so they begin the long journey into an uncertain future, a man and an elephant bound together by centuries of tradition but with less and less of a place in this world to call their own. —Philippe Gautier ", "likes": 1, "rating": 7.2, "comentarios": [" Aside from the English subs provided there are foreign language subs burnt into the MP4 movie, perhaps French, but not certain.

She developed the program in part as her own therapy to deal with the emotions surrounding her now ex-husband, Dex Finnegan, leaving her. She would also admit to herself that the boot camp is not easy in she herself having broken one of her own cardinal rules in recently having cyberstalked Dex. Among the disparate group that has signed up for the latest camp is magazine reporter Ben Meyers, a reluctant attendee who does not inherently believe in such therapy, viewing it solely as meaningless psychological mumbo-jumbo and a fad, but is attending as a favor to support his sister, Kim, who is dealing with the discovery of her ex-husband getting engaged, and who, in attending, does truly believe in such therapy being able to ease her pain. While Ben is indeed dealing with his last girlfriend Jennifer having recently broken up with him, Ben, if being honest to himself, would admit that it is the breakup with a former girlfriend, Serena, from ten years ago that has made him a broken man unable to commit. Two opposing items complicate matters between Miranda and Ben. First, they start to fall for each other, no dating between camp members one of the golden rules in the inherent issues with the rebound. That may be a moot point with the second in Ben's assignment editor Leo learning of he being in boot camp: to write an exposé on Miranda and the camp, a promotion to an editorial position and a corner office pending the resulting article. —Huggo ", "likes": 6, "rating": 6.7, "comentarios": [" Vuhngh...

Enamored beyond all good sense, Charlie begins to experience a myriad of unsettling incidents (an unstable voice from a vent, shadows that appear, eerie WiFi disruptions), and the horrors of what has transpired are slowly revealed in the shards of Charlie's resistant memory. They delightfully manifest in all those horror trope faves, yet still feel like a ripe pick off the branch.

Can they survive, reconnect with nature and rewrite their own rules of modern existence, or will they discover that society operates the way it does for a reason?EMMY Award-winning filmmaker, Trevor Hawkins of MAMMOTH, created his debut feature-film, Lotawana, in his own backyard on Lake Lotawana, Missouri by writing, directing, shooting, editing, financing (with a loan against his house) and literally almost dying in an underwater cave.Produced with his wife, Cori Jo Hawkins, and filmmaking partner, Nathan Kincaid, Hawkins and his skeleton-crew of ten renegades did all of their own stunts, shot on the water in every season with children and wildlife, and overcame massive obstacles including losing multiple lead actresses mid-production. Lead actor, Todd Blubaugh, even captained the sailboat on-screen by himself after only a fifteen-minute crash course and an encouraging slap on the rump. He then fell in love on-screen with leading lady, Nicola Collie, and they later married in real life. All of these adventures, and more, are featured in the hilarious, behind-the-scenes documentary, At The Helm: The Making of Lotawana.Lotawana's hidden centerpiece also gives a strong voice to a very commonly hushed, yet well-known struggle, rarely depicted in cinema.

Their journey begins in hot-bed areas of Tibetan activism in India and Nepal, before continuing into the most closed off regions of Tibet, during the full scale media blackout that began in 2008 and continues to this day. Their goal is to meet with leading Tibetan activists who are risking their lives to peacefully protest against oppression by the Chinese government's police state in a region kept 'in the dark'. Traveling undercover, a dangerous cat-and-mouse game unfolds as secret police maintain 24 hour surveillance of the filmmakers. Unable to document their intended subjects, they are forced to turn the cameras on themselves as they become the targets. All their moves are followed, leading to hotel break-ins, equipment theft, and cyber-hacking and spying - ultimately putting the filmmakers' very lives in danger. Forced to flee and return to the US, the filmmakers continue to roll-camera as they work with leading cyber security experts to confirm that multiple members of their production team were victims of cyber attacks proved to have originated in China. They realize they are not the only targets but are one small piece of the currently unfolding reality of global cyber-crime activity where seemingly nobody - individual activists, corporate giants or even governments - is immune. Google, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and almost one-fifth of the Fortune 100 are facing cyber assaults generated from within China...and at an unprecedented pace. Security breaches have reached as high up as the White House. Where does this leave the Tibetan resistance efforts? Their ongoing struggle for basic human rights and their cultural existence is no match for this high-tech war that they lack the technology and resources to fight. Desperate and frustrated, as of February 2013 over 100 Tibetans have turned to self- immolations in the hope the distressing images will be shared widely enough though social media and other technologies to catch the world's attention - but China's bans and tightening restrictions on information flowing into and out of Tibet make even these self-sacrifices little known to the outside world. Searching for a way to turn the tide, the filmmakers join forces with the activists they met on their journey for a bold media event in middle of Times Square, utilizing technology to help the voice of the Tibetans reach the world stage. —Anonymous ", "likes": 6, "rating": 6.8, "comentarios": [" Never seen so many shills for the CCP comment on the same item.

The documentary traces Dr. Rick Strassman's government-sanctioned, human DMT research and its many trials, tribulations, and inconceivable realizations. A closer examination of DMT's effects through the lens of two traditionally opposed concepts, science and spirituality, The Spirit Molecule explores the connections between cutting-edge neuroscience, quantum physics, and human spirituality. Strassman's research, and the experiences of the human test subjects before, during, and after the intense clinical trials, raises many intriguing questions. A variety of experts voice their unique thoughts and experiences with DMT within their respective fields. As Strassman's story unfolds, the contributors weigh in on his remarkable theories, including the synthesis of DMT in our brain's pineal gland, its link to near-death & alien-abduction experiences, the history/future of psychedelics, and the uncanny likeness to ancient religious texts describing prophets with DMT-like experiences. Additionally, the intriguing similarities to the 'many-worlds' interpretation of quantum mechanics lead to other fascinating discoveries. The experts offer a comprehensive collection of information, opinions, and speculation to help understand the nature of the DMT experience, and its role in human culture and the life force of our planet. Due to the profound nature, and visual phantasmagoria, of the DMT experience, the visual landscape of the film features stunning visualizations from Scott Draves (Electric Sheep), as well as a cutting-edge motion graphics, which demonstrate DMT's conceptual link to human evolution, construction of the universe, advanced neuroscience, and other alluring theories. Finally, stylized scenes reminiscent of Rod Sterling's famous Twilight Zone bookends, Joe Rogan (actor/comedian) serves as tour guide, helping navigate the expansive realms of Strassman's DMT universe.

Through interviews with his mother, two brothers, wife, and ex-girlfriends, as well as selections from his vast quantity of graphic art, we are treated to a darkly comic ride through one man's subconscious mind. As stream-of-consciousness images incessantly flow forth from the tip of his pen, biting social satire is revealed, often along with a disturbing and haunting vision of Crumb's own betes noires and inadequacies. As his acid-trip induced images flicker across our own retinas, we gain a little insight into this complex and highly creative individual. —Tad Dibbern ", "likes": 65, "rating": 8.0, "comentarios": [" Agree!

Gathered in exuberant daily ritual around the great Egguilibrium mechanism, which is tended by the silent owl, Hasan, they unthinkingly trade their eggs for fruit. Hupu, a beautiful and reckless young bird, is determined to save her egg from this terrible fate and with the help of Hasan, who is her husband, and a magical seed, she opposes Kondor and disrupts the system. In the wild chase that follows Hupu, Hasan, Kondor and a tiny busy-body chick called Mi, find themselves flung out of Birdabad into the jaws of the Horror. Terrified, confused, murderously angry with each other, this ill-assorted band form a reluctant alliance with a most peculiar guide, who promises to help them get home, if they will help him reach the Sun. Only Hupu knows that their guide is blind. Travelling from a vast modern city to the top of a volcano, down the slippery slope of a glacier or across the wide empty sea, always pursued by the Horror, our unlikely heroes cheat, lie, double-cross and abandon each other. Through a series of hilarious and hair-raising adventures, they are eventually forced to work together to face their fear of the Horror and win through to a happy ending that truly takes off. —Adnan Cuhara ", "likes": 2, "rating": 5.5, "comentarios": []}, "650": {"titulo": "Rocky Mountain Express", "anio": "2011", "generos": ["Documentary"], "director": "Stephen Low", "elenco": [], "sinopsis": " A history of the nation's first transcontinental railway accompanies a steam-train ride through the Canadian Rockies.

Gatti focuses on two men in a German concentration camp who have been cruelly penned inside an enclosure. One of the men, Karl (Herbert Wochinz), is a strong, bitter anti-Nazi German -- a target of the Gestapo. The SS wants information on a rumored organization of resistance fighters inside the prison and they know he has it. The other man, David (Jean Negroni) is a Jew. If one of the men dies within a certain time then the other will be released. He will not be killed. Otherwise, both will be executed. The resistance fighters in the prison try to help the two as best they can, while the pair inside the enclosure slowly come to know each other as though they were brothers. ~ Eleanor Mannikka, All Movie Guide ", "likes": 1, "rating": 6.8, "comentarios": []}, "733": {"titulo": "The Night House", "anio": "2020", "generos": ["Horror", "Mystery", "Thriller"], "director": "David Bruckner", "elenco": ["Samantha Buck", "Vondie Curtis-Hall", "Stacy Martin", "Sarah Goldberg"], "sinopsis": " Having buried her husband recently, emotionally scarred, grief-stricken high-school teacher Beth returns to the spacious, eerily vacant lake house he built for her in the heart of a gloomy forest.

Many have reported their own Men in Black experiences and eye witness accounts since the beginning of the UFO cover-up history. Mysterious men who seem to always show up right after credible UFO events. What are their motives? Explore the true history of Men in Black events from the 1940s until now with Richard Dolan, and Mike Ricksecker, Richard Doty, John Burroughs, many experiencers and many other researchers. Credible witnesses to UFO events always report the same pattern of events afterward. These events similarly recall an encounter with strange men who prove to have interest in coercing witnesses to stay quiet about what they experienced. Do these men work for some shadowy department of the government? Or are they not of this world? Being watched, stalked, followed by foot or car, and harassments by any means necessary seem to be common attributes to men in black encounters. Throughout history their tactics have evolved though. We now understand famous UFO debunkers and skeptics may have been supported by the military to close the lid on the UFO topic. Fake news and infiltration of the UFO research community becomes their next target.

Florence Burnier-Bauer was born in Paris in 1949 to an upper middle-class family with Russian roots. Raped by her Granddad at an early age and passed around in secret men's circles, she was hushed by electro-shocks in the insane asylum. Then she fled to the bohemian hobo lifestyle of the swinging sixties, taking off to a life of crime, bringing up three children on the road. Searched by the French police, she thought to find a safe haven in the free-loving Austrian Friedrichshof-Commune, led by Actionist Artist Otto Mühl. That is where hell really began. In 1989 Florence was able to escape. Her court appearance brought Mühl to jail for pedophilia, rape and orchestrated abuse. Her story is a highly unsettling testimonial about a time, known for its social liberalization. It is a showdown with counterculture icon Otto Mühl, previous documentaries had only hinted at. And a disturbing chronic to a shattered but unbroken life. And a ground-shaking mirror to the shadows behind the years of the post-war European Witschaftswunder, that shows how fascist structures and thinking was able to silently live on in the social underneath, even of the extreme left. —Paul Poet ", "likes": 1, "rating": 6.9, "comentarios": []}, "770": {"titulo": "Carnival of Souls", "anio": "1998", "generos": ["Drama", "Horror", "Mystery"], "director": "Adam Grossman", "elenco": ["Cleavant Derricks", "Henry G.

The production of food overall has more drastically changed since that time than the several thousand years prior. Controlled primarily by a handful of multinational corporations, the global food production business - with an emphasis on the business - has as its unwritten goals production of large quantities of food at low direct inputs (most often subsidized) resulting in enormous profits, which in turn results in greater control of the global supply of food sources within these few companies. Health and safety (of the food itself, of the animals produced themselves, of the workers on the assembly lines, and of the consumers actually eating the food) are often overlooked by the companies, and are often overlooked by government in an effort to provide cheap food regardless of these negative consequences. Many of the changes are based on advancements in science and technology, but often have negative side effects.The products made have been shown in several studies to enlarge male sexual organs and increase male breast size. The answer that the companies have come up with is to throw more science at the problems to bandage the issues but not the root causes. The global food supply may be in crisis with lack of biodiversity, but can be changed on the demand side of the equation. —Huggo ", "likes": 91, "rating": 7.8, "comentarios": [" Why the other comments are hidden?

During the course of the interview, Tony looks back at his extraordinarily eventful life. In the 1990s, Tony Finelli, an Italian-American from New York was a star in Europe. He found fame starring in 'ELVIS: The Musical' and together with his ever-present manager, Jürgen Drahtseil, turned that initial success into an international singing career. In 1997, at the height of Tony's fame, Jürgen was approached by an 'Italian Concert Promoter' regarding a big concert for Tony in Sicily. This 'promoter' turned out to be an undercover agent working for the German CIA and leading a secret sting operation to arrest 'Mr. Big' (Godfather of the Gambaretto Mafia Family), who was under investigation in Berlin for both tax evasion and money laundering. In over their heads and caught between the Mafia and the German CIA, Tony and Jürgen were faced with the choice of either going to prison for Mr. Big or having both of their families murdered by the mob. On the day they were released from prison, no one meets them at the gate. Tony returns to his home wanting to rebuild his life. Unbeknownst to Tony, his Russian wife Tina had filed for divorce shortly before his release. The former model and stewardess' reputation had been ruined by the scandal surrounding Tony's arrest. Alone with two children and no income, Tina turned their mansion into a bed and breakfast. Now, as the owner of Tony's former home, she lives there with their two daughters, Lola and Lena, now 27 and 20 years old. Tony's parents, Pete and Bea Finelli as well as his ancient, Sicilian grandmother 'Nonna' live in their own apartment upstairs - four generations of Finellis are living under one roof. Recently, the maintenance man in Tina's boarding house quit. Out of love for his family, Tony Finelli, the proud peacock, swallows his pride and takes over the job, hoping to rebuild his life, restart his career and reconnect with Tina and his children. Like a clumsy Phoenix trying to rise from the ashes, Tony, the eternal optimist, with his manager in tow, set out on a very bumpy journey to reclaim his life, and win back the love and respect of his family. Despite every setback possible, five years after his release from prison, Tony is back on top of the world. Sold-out world tours, a brand-new musical, and perhaps a new love?? The Barbara Bischof Interview is the crowning jewel in Tony's amazing 'comeback' story - showing us every pothole that Tony and Jürgen hit on their way back up the road to success.

With testimonies from those who fought to make wine in the 1975-90 civil war, the 2006 summer war, and those who continue to produce in the shadow of regional instability, this unique documentary frames their astonishing stories of bravery, determination, and survival and highlights how wine can be a unifier and a metaphor for life, hospitality, civilization, and a force for good in a region defined by turmoil and animosity, but which has a relationship with the vine that stretches back, almost 7,000 years. The Lebanese were the first wine merchants and they continue to travel the world. There are 4.5 million people in Lebanon, but a further 10 million of Lebanese descent are scattered across the five continents and they too can help forge a renewed sense of identity and pride among the diaspora. Because in a time of global angst, Lebanon is suffering more than most, not only dealing with the Covid pandemic, but also fighting corruption, environmental crises and sectarian politics not to mention navigating choppy economic waters.

Beynon is able to get Doc released, the sale price being for Doc to plan and execute a robbery at a small bank branch in Beacon City, Texas where Beynon knows that $750,000 will be kept in the vault for the next two weeks. Rather than Doc using his own men for the job, Beynon directs that the only other people involved will be the men of his own choosing, Rudy and Frank. There are to be no casualties, which is all right with Doc who is not a murderer. After the robbery is completed and the monies divvied up accordingly, Doc and Carol will cross the border into Mexico to live out their lives away from capture. The robbery doesn't go according to Doc's plan, and Doc and Carol go on the run making their way into Mexico with their share of the loot. Various people are in their pursuit, some who know that they will try to cross into Mexico at one of the two major West Texas border crossings. Other bystanders get directly or indirectly involved in the proceedings; two of those people, seeming straight-laced couple Fran and Harold Clinton, get much more intimately involved than the others. Though it all, Doc and Carol must work through some of their own issues, which arise out of a revelation about Doc's release from prison. —Huggo ", "likes": 84, "rating": 7.4, "comentarios": [" McQueen handles a firearms like he knows what he's doing, pretty cool and unusual, close to real life.
